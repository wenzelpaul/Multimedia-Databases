# Multimedia Databases Project
This repository contains the code of the Multimedia Databases course at the University.<br>
The project's goal was to create a service that uses [LIRE](https://github.com/dermotte/LIRE) (Lucene Image Retrieval) to retrive similar images from a database, using an example image as input.
It uses Spring Boot as Frontend and a REST webservice to access the images stored in an Oracle database.
